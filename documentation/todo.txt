tests
	construction
		center_ centered on same point as view with color(0,0,0,0)
	reset
		^
	set_center/move
		center_ centered on same point as view
	set_rotation/rotate
		initially 0.0
		rotation_ same angle as view
	scale
		initially 1.0
		zoom_ reflects accumulative scale changes, view grows/shrinks with factor
	set_size
		size, change size retaining zoom_

replace sf.View. with self. // skeptical
tint/flash box should simply be drawn after view is reset back to screen default, no rotation/scale/re-centering needed
settings.Resolution will track this screen size
